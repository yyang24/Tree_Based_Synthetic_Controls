# Tree Based Synthetic Control Prediction Intervals 
This repository contains a R suite to construct prediction intervals to estimate the casual effect of policy interventions in post-treatment periods, combining the conventional synthetic control methods with random forest framework. This method is applied to extend the seminal work of Abadie et al. (2010) on the influence of California's tabacco control program in 1988. 

See R files for the empirical extension.
